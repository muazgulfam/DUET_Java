Q. Can constructors be static in java? Try it out and justify.

Ans. No. In java, a static method does not have access to the instance variables of a class. 
    Constructors, on the other hand, are used to initialize instance variables and set up the initial state of an object.
    If a constructor were static, it would not be able to access the instance variables of the class and therefore would 
    not be able to initialize them properly.
